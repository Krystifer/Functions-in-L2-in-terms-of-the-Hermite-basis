# Functions-in-L2-in-terms-of-the-Hermite-basis
 The sequence in L2 (R) of Hermite polynomials can be orthonormalized, this constitutes a basis for the L2 space, then, in analogy with the n-dimensional case, any function f can be approximated by a linear combination of this sequence. This code graphs the approximation of various functions in terms of the 'Hermite base' at L2 (R).
